            <h2>Creating a Map using a Python Tiling Library hosted in Azure</h2>

            <p>
                The purpose of this task was to create a map of a manufacturing facility in order to effectivly communicate with other departments
                where data screens where going to be placed in the expansion of the facility. To do so, an AutoCAD drawing was created by the engineering department 
                of the company. In order to get that image to be able to be displayed by Leaflet, the image first needed to go through a process known as 'Tiling'. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This process effectivly slices the image in many many tiny little pieces that a Library such as Leaflet can stitch together to form a map. To accomplish this,
                Leaflet has variace zoom levels that the map utilizes, each level having expontentially more images than the previous. These zoom levels are specified when the image
                is being tiled, in the case of this project, gdal2tiles was used. Once the map and its accompanying webpage was made, the marker system that was denoting where the screens 
                would be placed needed to be tweaked. Before, the map markers were hard-coded for ease of testing. Once everything was verified to be working, the marker data was moved to 
                a MS SQL Server Database that was created using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/">Entity Framework</a>. This allowed anyone in charge of updating the map to 
                edit the marker data with just a datebase update, rather than changing code. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, the expontential aspect of the tiling process ended leading to an interesting dilemma. Initally, the images were being stored alongside the JavaScript code, however, 
                having 10's of thousands of images stored alongside code is not ideal. So a solution had to be found so that the code could still reach the images to properly display the map. 
                To solve this, Microsoft's Azure Blob Storage was utilzed. This Azure service let us store the mass amount of images inside a blob storage that simply could be called
                from the code to fetch the needed images.
            </p>

            
               
            <p>Here is an example map created using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/" target="_blank">Leaflet's quickstart guide</a>. </p>

            <div id="map"></div>
            <script src="./mapView.js"></script>

            <h2>Creating a Webpage To Display Data From a Database</h2>

            <p>  
                There was an already existing webpage where this data was accessiable, however, it needed to be within a different app than the current one. The current page was housed
                inside an app using Vue, Pinia, and Tailwind but needed to be moved into an app where none of those were being used. Instead, it had to be created using the MVC Pattern with
                Razor Syntax. The data was going to be coming from an Azure SQL Database accessed using a Key Vault System set up prior by a Senior Developer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Considering that I had already been tasked with adding additional data to the existing page, creating the same webpage in a different app was not all that difficult. The main challenge
                was keeping functionality the same and adding a few more data aspects to the displayed output. 
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Creating an API to handle data requests for a Webpage</h2>

            <p> 
                As an onboarding project to get familiar with how all the companies' system worked, a front end application needed to be created as well as an API to go alongside it.
                The main goal of this project was to create a page that pulled customer data from the database and display various details about the customer and what was ordered. There
                needed to be a starting page where about 30 of the most recent orders where displayed with the Date, Order ID, Customer ID, etc. were displayed. When you clicked on a table row
                there were two options that could have been implemented: The first was a redirect to another page that had more details about the customer and the order, the second was to have a popup
                known as a modal appear and display the data that way.  
            </p>

            <p> 
                As this was the first I project worked on, there was a significant learning curve involved in order to get everything up and running. There was a template provided for the API part of the 
                project, however, ehe entire webpage needed to be set up using Vue, Pinia, Tailwind, and Microsoft's .NET Framework. The API then had to code and setup to work with the webpage and return 
                data to it from API calls. The only call that this project needed was simply GET requests.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is a bare bones example of what the functionality of the project looked like once it was completed:
            </p>

            <table>
                <tr style="background-color: gray">
                  <th>Order #</th>
                  <th>Customer Name</th>
                  <th>Date</th>
                  <th>Status</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>01</td>
                  <td>John Doe</td>
                  <td>01 - 01 - 9999</td>
                  <td>Completed</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>02</td>
                  <td>Jane Doe</td>
                  <td>12 - 12 - 9999</td>
                  <td>In Progress</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                Once a row was clicked on, much more information was displayed such as Date Ordered, Address, Shipping Method, Order Notes, and so on.

            <h2>Card Stack and Flipping</h2>
        </li>
            <p> 
                In this project, a console input was given that contained cards from a standard deck.  After the list of cards were given, a flipping order was then inputted. 
                For example, the first part of the input would look similar to this:
            
                <div>
                    <table class = "cardListMain" >
                        <tr>
                            <td>UHA </td>
                            <td>US5 </td>
                            <td>DHK </td>
                            <td>UDA </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr class="bottomRow">
                            <td>DD10 </td>
                            <td>DS6 </td>
                            <td>UH3 </td>
                            <td>DS4 </td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </div>

                This input had to saved in a multidimensial array so that a sequence of flipping intructions could be performed. The cards that are inputted have a specific
                code to them. The first letter was either 'U' or 'D' signifying face-up or face-down. The 2nd letter was the suit of the card; C for Clubs, D for Diamonds, 
                H for Hearts, and S for Spades. Then the last portion signified the value. After the cards are inputed, a string of flipping intructions would follow such as "ULR".
                For this string, D means flip (more like fold) the array downwards, L means flip towards the left, R means flip towards the right, and U means flip upwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                These intructions had predefined rules:
                
                <ol class="ruleList" >
                    <li>
                        Each time a flip happened, the card had to switch from from face-up to face-down and vise verse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each card that was flipped onto another card had to be placed into a stack with that other card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each flip would halve the remaining number of rows or columns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a row or column is flipped, the cards are taken off and placed in the new row / column starting with the top of the stack.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                In this instance, note that a card to the left of another in the table means on top of. So, executing the string "ULR" would yield the results of:

                <div style="padding-top: 40px; ">
                    <table class = "cardList" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
                        <tr>
                            <td>UD10, UHA</td>
                            <td>US5, US6</td>
                            <td>DH3, DHK</td>
                            <td>US4, UDA</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    
                    <span>--> </span>

                    <table class = "cardList" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
                        <tr>
                            <td>UDA, DS4, UD10, UHA</td>
                            <td>UHK, UH3, US5, US6</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    
                    <span>--> </span>

                    <table class = "cardList" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
                        <tr>
                            <td>UHK, UH3, US5, US6, UDA, DS4, UD10, UHA</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                </div>
              
            </p>

            <p>
                With this result, the King of Hearts would be face-up on the top of the stack while the Ace of Hearts would be face-up on the bottom of the stack.
